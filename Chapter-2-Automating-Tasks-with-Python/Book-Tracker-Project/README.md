# Chapter 2: Book Tracker Project - AI Python for Beginners
## 📚 Project Overview
This is the second major assignment from the **AI Python for Beginners** course by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera. The project focuses on creating a book tracking system to practice Python dictionary operations, conditional logic, loops, and AI integration for automated email generation.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
+ Python dictionary creation and manipulation

+ Conditional statements (if/else logic)

+ Looping through data structures

+ String formatting and f-strings

+ AI integration for automated content generation

+ Problem-solving with real-world scenarios

## 📁 Files Included
### 1. `book_tracker_original.py`
+ Original submission as completed for the Coursera assignment

+ Basic implementation meeting course requirements

### 2. `book_tracker_clean_code.py`
+ Refactored and optimized code

+ Enhanced readability and structure

+ Comprehensive bilingual comments (Chinese/English)

+ Improved error handling and user experience

## 💻 Code Features
### 📖 Exercise 1: Book Inventory Management
+ Dictionary creation with multiple data types

+ Key-value pair initialization

+ Complex data structure design

### 🤔 Exercise 2: Availability Checking System
+ Boolean logic implementation

+ Conditional statement with AND operator

+ User-friendly status messaging

### ⏳ Exercise 3: Book Status Management
+ Advanced conditional logic with f-strings

+ Dictionary value updating

+ Dynamic message generation based on book status

### 🔎 Exercise 4: Borrower Tracking
+ List iteration with dictionaries

+ Data matching and extraction

+ Contact information retrieval

### 🤖 Exercise 5: AI Email Generation
+ LLM integration for automated content creation

+ Prompt engineering with dynamic variables

+ Professional email template generation
