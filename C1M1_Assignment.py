# # Programming Assignment: Working with a Virtual Library üíª
# 
# Welcome to your first graded assignment! In this assignment, you'll be working with a virtual library system. Don't worry, you won't be actually coding the library. Instead, you'll be using your Python skills to interact with some pre-defined library information.

# ## Before you begin üö¶

# If you **need a fresh copy of the assignment (reset)**, follow the [instructions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-python-for-beginners/supplement/uW6bd/optional-downloading-your-notebook-downloading-your-workspace-and-refreshing) under the heading, "`Refreshing your Workspace`".
# 
# <h2 style="color:green; font-weight:bold;">INSTRUCTIONS FOR ATTEMPTING THE ASSIGNMENT:</h2>
# 
# - Before starting each exercise, read the instructions carefully. Look for the part called **Your Task**, it tells you exactly what you need to code and gives you all the details you need.
# 
# 
# - In each exercise cell, look for comments `### START CODE HERE ###` and `### END CODE HERE ###`. These show you where to write your code. **Do not add or change any code that is outside these comments, or add any extra code cells in the notebook.**
# 
# 
# - After you finish coding an exercise, there will be a test section that checks your work using a function called `test_your_code`. If everything is correct, you'll see a message saying "<span style="color: green;">All tests passed!</span>" and you can move on. <span style="color: red;">If there's a mistake, you'll see a red message explaining what went wrong, so you can fix it.</span>
# 
# 
# - **Before submitting your notebook for grading, ensure ALL exercises are complete (gotten All tests passed! for all of them)**. Save your work by clicking the üíæ icon at the top left, then click the <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Submit assignment</span> button at the top right.
# 
# <h2 style="color:green; font-weight:bold;">ASKING FOR HELP IN THE COMMUNITY FORUM:</h2>
# 
# - Sign up for our [Community Forum](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-python-for-beginners/supplement/No2f2/important-have-questions-issues-or-ideas-join-our-forum) if you haven't already. Once signed up, post your questions in the [AP4B category](https://community.deeplearning.ai/c/course-q-a/ai-python-for-beginners/463) with detailed information, such as the item's name, exercise number, or code cell. This helps others understand your issue better. Share screenshots if you can, but **don't post solution code publicly**; instead, share the error message you receive.

# ### Exercise 1-A: Defining Variables
# 
# One of the books available in your virtual library is:
# 
# | Book Title          | Author             | Year Published | Available Copies |
# |---------------------|---------------------|---------------|-----------------|
# | Brave New World | Aldous Huxley    | 1932           | 4              |
# 
# 
# **Your Task:** 
# 
# Store the information of this book into Python variables `book_title`, `author`, `year_published` and `available_copies`

# In[3]:


### START CODE HERE ###

# Store the title of the book `Brave New World` as a string
book_title ="Brave New World" # Add your code here

# Store the author `Aldous Huxley` of the book as a string
author="Aldous Huxley"# Add your code here

# Store the year `1932` the book was published as an integer
year_published=1932 # Add your code here

# Store the number of available copies `4` of the book as an integer
available_copies=4 # Add your code here

### END CODE HERE ###


# Run the next cell to check if your code is correct. In case you receive an error please make sure you defined the required variables with the correct names.

# In[4]:


# Test your code!
test_your_code.exercise_1a(book_title, author, year_published, available_copies)


# **Important Note:** If you see <span style="color: green;">All tests passed!</span>, you can proceed to the next step. If there's an error message <span style="color: red;">in red</span>, follow the instructions to fix it, then re-run the exercise and test cells until you get the <span style="color: green;">All tests passed!</span> message. Repeat this process for all exercises in the assignment.

# ### Exercise 1-B: Print Statements 
# 
# **Your Task:**
# 
# Write a Python program using **f-string** that uses the above variables (`book_title`, `author`, `year_published` and `available_copies`) to print information about the book in the following format:
# 
# ```
# Title: <Book Title>
# Author: <Author>
# Published: <Year Published>
# Available Copies: <Available Copies>
# ```
# 
# Make sure to use a separate print statement for every variable!

# In[8]:


### START CODE HERE ###

# Print the Title: `book_title` using an f-string
print(f"Title: {book_title}")

# Print the Author: `author` using an f-string
print(f"Author: {author}")

# Print Published: `year_published` using an f-string
print(f"Published: {year_published}")

# Print Available Copies: `available_copies` using an f-string
print(f"Available Copies: {available_copies}")

### END CODE HERE ###


# #### Expected Output:
# 
# ```
# Title: Brave New World
# Author: Aldous Huxley
# Published: 1932
# Available Copies: 4
# ```

# ## Exercise 2: Checking Out a Book üìñ
# 
# Now, let's imagine an user wants to check out the book "Brave New World".
# 
# **Your Task:**
# 
# Write a program that:
# 
# 1.  **Reduces** the number of `available_copies` by 1 (representing a book being checked out). 
#     - The current `available_copies` for the book "Brave New World" are `4`.
#     
# <details>
# <summary><span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">Hint (Click here to open)</span></summary>
# 
# In Python, you can update the value of a variable using the variable itself. For example:  
# If `number_of_apples = 5`  
# doing  
# `number_of_apples = number_of_apples + 2`  
# will be a valid line of code. Now the updated value of `number_of_apples` will be 7.
# 
# </details>

# 2.  **Prints** a message confirming the checkout, including the book title (`book_title`) and the remaining available copies (`available_copies`).
#     - The printed message should be in the format using **multi-line f-string** as, `One copy of <Book Title> checked out. There are now <Available Copies> copies available.`

# In[10]:


available_copies = 4 ### DO NOT EDIT OR REMOVE THIS CODE LINE

### START CODE HERE ###

# 1. Reduce the number of "available_copies" by a value of 1
available_copies = available_copies-1

# 2. Print the message, confirming the checkout. Use multi-line f-string
# In your print statment, use "book_title" you implemented in exercise 1
# Use "available_copies" you calculated above
print(f"""
One copy of {book_title} checked out. There are now {available_copies} copies available.
""")

### END CODE HERE ###


# #### Expected Output:
# ```
# One copy of Brave New World checked out. There are now 3 copies available.
# ```

# In[11]:


# Test your code!
test_your_code.exercise_2(available_copies)  


# <a name='3'></a>
# ## Exercise 3: Book Request üìö 
# 
# An user wants to borrow "To Kill a Mockingbird". However, there are no copies currently available.
# 
# | Book Title          | Author             | Year Published | Available Copies |
# |---------------------|---------------------|---------------|-----------------|
# | To Kill a Mockingbird| Harper Lee         | 1960           | 0              |
# 
# **Your Task:**
# 
# Write Python code that:
# 
# 1.  **Stores** the name of the requested book in a variable called `requested_book`.
# 2.  **Prints** a message telling the user that the book is currently unavailable, but they can request it.
#     - The printed message should be in the format using **multi-line f-string** as, `<Requested Book> is currently unavailable. You can request it from the library.`

# In[12]:


### START CODE HERE ###

# 1. Store the name of the book `To Kill a Mockingbird` in a variable called `requested_book`
requested_book="To Kill a Mockingbird"

# 2. Print the message using multi-line f-string
print(f"""{requested_book} is currently unavailable. You can request it from the library.""")

### END CODE HERE ###


# #### Expected Output:
# ```
# To Kill a Mockingbird is currently unavailable. You can request it from the library.
# ```

# In[13]:


# Test your code!
test_your_code.exercise_3(requested_book)  


# ### Submission Note:
# If you have passed all the tests up to this point, you can submit your assignment for grading.
# 
# **But before you submit your assignment, re-run the assignment just in case there are any unexpected errors present in the notebook once it goes for grading.** To do so, follow these steps:
# 
# 1. Restart the `Kernel` and select the `Restart & Clear Output` option. You can do this by clicking on the `Kernel` menu at the top of the notebook.
# ![Kernel Restart Image](kernel_restart.png)
# 2. Once the kernel restarts and all outputs are clear, run the cells from top to bottom again up to this point.
# 
# If you have followed these steps and still pass all of the tests, you can submit your assignment for grading. If you encounter any errors, please fix them before submitting.
# 
# To submit your assignment for grading, save your work by clicking the üíæ icon at the top left, then click the <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Submit assignment</span> button at the top right. Good luck!
