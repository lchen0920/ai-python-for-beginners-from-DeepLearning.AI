# # Programming Assignment: Pluto's Poetic Journey üöÄ 
# 
# Welcome to your next mission! üßë‚ÄçüöÄ In this exciting adventure, you'll be diving into the fascinating world of space exploration and poetry (yes, you read that right, poetry! üñãÔ∏è). You'll be using Python to analyze a captivating news article about the New Horizons spacecraft's journey to Pluto and its discoveries. Get ready to flex your coding muscles and unleash your inner poet! üí´
# 
# ## The Mission Briefing üì∞
# 
# Your mission begins with a [news article](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/15/world/pluto-new-horizons-anniversary-scn-trnd/index.html) detailing the incredible findings from the New Horizons mission. The spacecraft has sent back a treasure trove of information about the dwarf planet Pluto, revealing its secrets and captivating our imaginations. However, the article is quite long, and you need a more efficient way to understand its key themes.
# 
# Time for your Python skills to blast off! üöÄ

# ## Before you begin üö¶

# If you **need a fresh copy of the assignment (reset)**, follow the [instructions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-python-for-beginners/supplement/uW6bd/optional-downloading-your-notebook-downloading-your-workspace-and-refreshing) under the heading, "`Refreshing your Workspace`".
# 
# <h2 style="color:green; font-weight:bold;">INSTRUCTIONS FOR ATTEMPTING THE ASSIGNMENT:</h2>
# 
# - Before starting each exercise, read the instructions carefully. Look for the part called **Your Task**, it tells you exactly what you need to code and gives you all the details you need.
# 
# 
# - In each exercise cell, look for comments `### START CODE HERE ###` and `### END CODE HERE ###`. These show you where to write your code. **Do not add or change any code that is outside these comments, or add any extra code cells in the notebook.**
# 
# 
# - After you finish coding an exercise, there will be a test section that checks your work using a function called `test_your_code`. If everything is correct, you'll see a message saying "<span style="color: green;">All tests passed!</span>" and you can move on. <span style="color: red;">If there's a mistake, you'll see a red message explaining what went wrong, so you can fix it.</span>
# 
#

# ## Exercise 1: Encountering Data - Reading the News Article üõ∞Ô∏è
# 
# First things first, you need to access the news article. It's like receiving a transmission from a faraway probe - you need to decode it first. 
# 
# **Your Task:**
# 
# * Define a Python function called `read_article` that takes a `text_file` (string) as a parameter and reads the contents of the file. The function should return the contents of the file.
# 
# <span style="color: blue;">**Hint**</span>: You can refer to the classroom lesson *Turning code blocks into reusable functions* for this.

# In[2]:


# Define a Python function "read_article" and pass "text_file" as parameter
def read_article(text_file):
    
    ### START CODE HERE ###
        # "Open" "text_file" in "read" mode
    
    f = open(text_file, "r")
        # Use "f.read()" to read the file into "contents"
    contents = f.read()# Add your code here
    f.close()# Close the file "f.close()"

    return contents # Add your return variable here


    


    
    ### END CODE HERE ###


# In[3]:


# Test your code!
test_your_code.exercise_1(read_article)


# **Important Note:** If you see <span style="color: green;">All tests passed!</span>, you can proceed to the next step. If there's an error message <span style="color: red;">in red</span>, follow the instructions to fix it, then re-run the exercise and test cells until you get the <span style="color: green;">All tests passed!</span> message. Repeat this process for all exercises in the assignment.

# ## Exercise 2: Decoding the Cosmos - Extracting Key Topics üî≠
# 
# Great work, your `read_article` function is working like a charm! Use it to receive your transmission:
# 
# You'll be using the news article [5 years after its Pluto flyby, New Horizons spacecraft forges ahead](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/15/world/pluto-new-horizons-anniversary-scn-trnd/index.html), published on July 15, 2020, written by CNN. This article has been saved in a `news_article.txt` file in your workspace.
# 
# Print the contents of this news article.

# In[4]:


news_article = read_article("news_article.txt")
print(news_article)


# That is a lengthy article! To decipher its secrets without reading every word, employ a powerful tool: a Large Language Model (LLM). Think of it as your trusty AI assistant, capable of understanding and summarizing vast amounts of information. üß†
# 
# You'll ask the LLM to analyze the news article and extract three key topics discussed.

# In[5]:


prompt = f"""
Read the contents of file {news_article}, and extract the key topics discussed in it. Provide exactly 3 key topics.
Each topic should not be more than 8 words.

Provide each topic in a new line.

Output Format:
topic_1

topic_2

topic_3

"""

response = get_llm_response(prompt)


# In[6]:


# Print the response
print(response)


# **Your Task:**
# 
# Turn these topics into a single Python list.
# * Copy/paste the topics generated from `response` above into the `key_topics` list below.
# 
# Be sure that:
# * Each topic is stored as a "string"
# * There are no duplicate topics in your list
# * Don't forget to use a comma `,` after each entry in the list. For example:
# 
# ```python
# 	key_topics = [
# 		"Topic 1",
# 		"Topic 2",
# 		"Topic 3"
# 	]
# ```

# In[7]:


key_topics = [
    
    ### START CODE HERE ###
    
    "Pluto's geological activity and features",
    
    "New Horizons' discoveries and insights",
    
    "Future Kuiper Belt Object exploration plans"
    
    ### END CODE HERE ###

]

print_formatted_list(key_topics)


# #### Expected Output:
# ```
# [
#     "Unique Topic 1 as a string",
#     "Unique Topic 2 as a string",
#     "Unique Topic 3 as a string"
# ]
# ```

# ## Exercise 3: The Poet's Palette - Organizing Your Topics üé® 
# 
# Excellent work, your `key_topics` list is ready for action! Now, imagine you want to write a poem inspired by these topics, but you're not particularly fond of one or more of them.
# 
# To give you more control over your creative process, you'll be crafting a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing a topic and a special "switch" called `to_use`. This "switch" will tell the LLM whether or not to include a particular topic in the poem. It's like having a poet's palette, carefully selecting the colors and themes you want to use in your masterpiece! üé®
# 
# **Your Task:**
# 
# Create a list of dictionaries `topics_to_use` with each topic from the list `key_topics` and a switch `to_use`. 
# 
# In each dictionary:
# * Use the list `key_topics` to get the topic and add them into the new dictionary.
# * Add a boolean value `to_use` (True would mean to use it in the Poem, False would mean not to use). Feel free to put True/False as you desire.
# 
# Be sure that:
# * There are no duplicate topics in your list
# * Don't forget to use a comma `,` after each entry in the dictionary and after each dictionary. For example:
# ```python
# 	{
# 		"Topic 1": your topic,
# 		
# 		"to_use": a boolean value
# 	},
# 	{
# 		"Topic 2": your topic,
# 		
# 		"to_use": a boolean value
# 	}
# ```

# In[12]:


topics_to_use = [
    
    ### START CODE HERE ###
    
    {
        # Use your the "first" entry from "key_topics" as "Topic 1"
        # Hint: Remember, in Python, counting starts from zero (0)
        "Topic 1":"Pluto's geological activity and features", # First element from the list "key_topics" goes here,
        
        # Use a boolean value (True or False) for "to_use"
        "to_use":False # Add boolean value here
    },
    {
        # Use your the "second" entry from "key_topics" as "Topic 2"
        "Topic 2":"New Horizons' discoveries and insights", # Second element from the list "key_topics" goes here,
        
        # Use a boolean value (True or False) for "to_use"
        "to_use":True # Add boolean value here
    },
    {
        # Use your the "third" entry from "key_topics" as "Topic 3"
        "Topic 3":"Future Kuiper Belt Object exploration plans", # Third element from the list "key_topics" goes here,
        
        # Use a boolean value (True or False) for "to_use"
        "to_use":True # Add boolean value here
    }
    
    ### END CODE HERE ###
    
]
    
print_formatted_list_of_dict(topics_to_use)


# #### Expected Output:
# ```
# [
#     {
#         "Topic 1": "Unique Topic 1 as a string",
#         "to_use": A boolean value,
#     },
#     {
#         "Topic 2": "Unique Topic 2 as a string",
#         "to_use": A boolean value,
#     },
#     {
#         "Topic 3": "Unique Topic 3 as a string",
#         "to_use": A boolean value,
#     }
# ]
# ```

# <a name='4'></a>
# ## Exercise 4: Cosmic Sonnets - Writing Your Space Poem üñãÔ∏è
# 
# With your `topics_to_use` list ready, it's time to enlist the LLM once again, this time for a more creative task: crafting your space poem! üå†
# 
# **Your Task:**
# 
# Write a `prompt` that asks the LLM to generate a `poem`. The `poem` should be of exactly `4 (four)` `lines (line)`. Your `prompt` should also include the `topics_to_use` list.
# 
#     You have the flexibility to structure your prompt and wording as you see fit. The key is to include all three pieces of information (`topics_to_use` list, mention of writing a "poem" and using only "4 (four) lines (line)") naturally within the `prompt`'s instructions. 
# 
#     For example, your prompt could look something like this: 
#     "Using only the topics from the list <topics_to_use>, write a 4-line poem."

# In[17]:


### START CODE HERE ###

prompt = f"""
write a poem, the poem should be of exactly 4 lines from {topics_to_use} 
"""

### END CODE HERE ###

print(prompt)


# #### Expected Output:
# ```
# Your prompt containing the following details:
# - `topics_to_use` list
# - Instructions of writing a "poem"
# - Using only "4 (four) lines (line)"
# ```

# **Note:** You will fail the below test if your prompt excludes any one of the above mentioned details.

# In[18]:


# Test your code!    
test_your_code.exercise_4(prompt, topics_to_use)    


# In[19]:


poem = get_llm_response(prompt)


# In[20]:


# Print your poem
print(poem)


# <a name='5'></a>
# ## Exercise 5: Preserving the Verse - Saving Your Poem üíæ 
# 
# Your poem is a masterpiece! But like a fading transmission, it won't last forever unless you store it properly.
# 
# **Your Task:**
# 
# * Create a Python function called `save_to_file` that uses the parameter `contents_to_save` (a string) and saves it in a file called `poem.txt`.
# 
# <span style="color: blue;">**Hint**</span>: You can refer to the classroom lesson *Extracting restaurant information from journal entries* for this.

# In[21]:


# Define a Python function "save_to_file" and pass "contents_to_save" as parameter
def save_to_file(contents_to_save):
    
    ### START CODE HERE ###
    
    # Using "Open", open or create a text file `poem.txt` in "write" mode
    f = open("poem.txt", 'w')
    
    ### END CODE HERE ###
    
    # Write "contents_to_save" in the file `poem.txt`
    f.write(contents_to_save)
    
    # Close the file
    f.close()


# In[22]:


# Test your code!    
test_your_code.exercise_5(save_to_file) 


# ### Submission Note:
