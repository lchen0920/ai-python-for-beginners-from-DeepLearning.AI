# # Programming Assignment: üç≠ Candy Analysis üìä

# Welcome to the last programming assignment! üéâ You've been tasked by "DeepLearning.AI Sugar Rush Delights" üç¨ to perform analysis on their candy catalog. üç¨ You have to dive into some sweet data about different candies, figure out which ones are the most popular, and give the marketing team some insights to sweeten their campaigns. üí™ Let's get started!

# ## Before you begin üö¶

# If you **need a fresh copy of the assignment (reset)**, follow the [instructions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-python-for-beginners/supplement/uW6bd/optional-downloading-your-notebook-downloading-your-workspace-and-refreshing) under the heading, "`Refreshing your Workspace`".
# 
# <h2 style="color:green; font-weight:bold;">INSTRUCTIONS FOR ATTEMPTING THE ASSIGNMENT:</h2>
# 
# - Before starting each exercise, read the instructions carefully. Look for the part called **Your Task**, it tells you exactly what you need to code and gives you all the details you need.
# 
# 
# - In each exercise cell, look for comments `### START CODE HERE ###` and `### END CODE HERE ###`. These show you where to write your code. **Do not add or change any code that is outside these comments, or add any extra code cells in the notebook.**
# 
# 
# - After you finish coding an exercise, there will be a test section that checks your work using a function called `test_your_code`. If everything is correct, you'll see a message saying "<span style="color: green;">All tests passed!</span>" and you can move on. <span style="color: red;">If there's a mistake, you'll see a red message explaining what went wrong, so you can fix it.</span>
# 
# 
# - **Before submitting your notebook for grading, ensure ALL exercises are complete (gotten All tests passed! for all of them)**. Save your work by clicking the üíæ icon at the top left, then click the <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Submit assignment</span> button at the top right.
# 
# <h2 style="color:green; font-weight:bold;">ASKING FOR HELP IN THE COMMUNITY FORUM:</h2>

# ## Exercise 1: Unwrapping the Data üéÅ
# 
# **Instructions:**
# 
# - The `ex1_helper_functions.py` file includes two functions:
#     -  `read_candy_data`: This function will help you open up the candy data file and see what's inside.  Think of it like opening a box of chocolates! üç´
#     - `display_table`: This handy function takes the candy data you've read and displays it neatly in a table.
#     
# -  Import both of these helpful functions from the `ex1_helper_functions` file.
# 
# **Your task:**
# 
# - Import all (`*`) of the functions from the `ex1_helper_functions`

# In[13]:


### START CODE HERE ###

from ex1_helper_functions import *
# Import using the format "from file_name import all (*)"
# Add your code here

### END CODE HERE ###


# **Note:** Once you see the <span style="color: green;">All tests passed! Correct import statement used!</span> message, you can proceed the next step. Otherwise, it would mean your import statement or its format is not as expected. Fix it based on the feedback and re-run the exercise and test cells.

# In[14]:


# Test your code!
test_your_code.check_ex1_import_statement()


# **Your task:**
# *   Put that `read_candy_data` function to work!  Use it to read the file `candy_data.csv`. 
#     *   Make sure you pass the file name `candy_data.csv` as a string to the function.    

# In[32]:


### START CODE HERE ###

# Use 'read_candy_data' to read the file `candy_data.csv`
candy_data = read_candy_data('candy_data.csv')



 # Add your code here

### END CODE HERE ###

# Display the contents loaded into the `candy_data` variable
display_table(candy_data)


# #### Expected Output
# 
# | Candy Name            | Popularity Score | Price in USD |
# |-----------------------|------------------|------------------|
# | Twix  | 92  | 1.25               |
# | PayDay     | 83  | 1.00               |

# ## Exercise 2: Popularity Contest! üèÜ
# 
# **Instructions:**
# 
# - The `ex2_helper_functions.py` file has more tools for you!
#     - `get_popularity_scores`: This function goes through your candy data and pulls out just the popularity scores. Think of it like separating the cherry filling from the rest of the candy. üçí
#     -  `print_scores`: This function takes a list of scores and prints them for you.
# 
# **Your task:**
# 
# - Import the two `get_popularity_scores` and `print_scores` functions from `ex2_helper_functions`

# In[36]:


### START CODE HERE ###

# Import using the format "from file_name import function_name_1, function_name_2"
# Add your code here
from ex2_helper_functions import get_popularity_scores, print_scores
### END CODE HERE ###


# **Note:** Once you see the <span style="color: green;">All tests passed! Correct import statement used!</span> message, you can proceed the next step. Otherwise, it would mean your import statement or its format is not as expected. Fix it based on the feedback and re-run the exercise and test cells.

# In[37]:


# Test your code!
test_your_code.check_ex2_import_statement()


# **Your task:**
# *   Now, let's see those popularity scores! Use the `get_popularity_scores` function with the `candy_data` you loaded earlier. 

# In[42]:


### START CODE HERE ###

# Use 'get_popularity_scores' and pass in the lst `candy_data`
popularity_scores = get_popularity_scores(candy_data)# Add your code here

### END CODE HERE ###

# Print the `popularity_scores` list
print_scores(popularity_scores)


# #### Expected Output:
# 
# ```
# [92, 83, 85, 84, 83, 94, 84, 95, 84, 83, 91, 83, 88, 84, 84, 84, 84, 84, 84]
# ```

# In[43]:


# Test your code!
test_your_code.exercise_2(popularity_scores)


# <a name='3'></a>
# ## Exercise 3: Finding the Average Sweet Spot üéØ
# 
# **Instructions:**
# 
# - Python has a special built-in module called `statistics`.  It's like a secret compartment in your candy box full of useful tools! üß∞ 
# - You're going to use the `mean` function from the module `statistics` to find the average popularity score.
# 
# **Your task:**
# 
# - Import the Python package `statistics` *as* `stats`

# In[44]:


### START CODE HERE ###

# Import using the format "import module_name as alias"
import statistics as stats
# Use the alias name as "stats"
# Add your code here

### END CODE HERE ###


# **Note:** Once you see the <span style="color: green;">All tests passed! Correct import statement used!</span> message, you can proceed the next step. Otherwise, it would mean your import statement or its format is not as expected. Fix it based on the feedback and re-run the exercise and test cells.

# In[45]:


# Test your code!
test_your_code.check_ex3_import_statement()


# **Your task:**
# 
# * Time to calculate! Use the `mean` function from your `stats` module (remember how to use an alias with the dot `.` ) to find the average popularity score of all the candies.

# In[56]:


### START CODE HERE ###

# Access the "mean" function in "stats"

# Pass "popularity_scores" to the mean function

avg_popularity = stats.mean(popularity_scores)# Add your code here

### END CODE HERE ###

### Print the average upto 2 decimal places
print(f"Average Popularity Score: {avg_popularity:.2f}")


# #### Expected Output
# 
# ```
# Average Popularity Score: 85.95
# ```

# In[57]:


# Test your code!
test_your_code.exercise_3(avg_popularity)


# <a name='4'></a>
# ## Exercise 4: The Top Candy Leaderboard ü•á
# 
# 
# **Instructions:**
# 
# - You have even more tools in your `ex4_helper_functions.py` file!
#     -  `get_top_candies`:  This function is like a talent scout - it will find the candies whose popularity scores are above a certain level, "avg_popularity" (the average popularity you calculated in Exercise 3). 
#     -  `display_pretty_table`:  This one makes the results look extra nice. ‚ú®
# 
# **Your task:**
# 
# - Import the entire file `ex4_helper_functions`

# In[58]:


### START CODE HERE ###

# Import using the format "import file_name"
import ex4_helper_functions
# Add your code here

### END CODE HERE ###


# **Note:** Once you see the <span style="color: green;">All tests passed! Correct import statement used!</span> message, you can proceed the next step. Otherwise, it would mean your import statement or its format is not as expected. Fix it based on the feedback and re-run the exercise and test cells.

# In[59]:


# Test your code!
test_your_code.check_ex4_import_statement()


# **Your task:**
# 
# - Use the `get_top_candies` function to round up all the candies that have a popularity score higher than or equal to the `avg_popularity` you found. 
# 
# <details>
#     <summary><span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Hint: (click here to open)</span></summary>
#     <p>When you have imported the entire module/local file, you can access any function from it using the <code>.</code> (dot) character.</p>
# </details>

# In[66]:


### START CODE HERE ###

# Access the "get_top_candies" function in "ex4_helper_functions"
# Pass "candy_data" and "avg_popularity" to the "get_top_candies" function
top_candies = ex4_helper_functions.get_top_candies(candy_data,avg_popularity)# Add yur code here

### END CODE HERE ###

### Display the "top_candies" list
ex4_helper_functions.display_pretty_table(top_candies)


# #### Expected Output:

# ## Exercise 5: Crafting the Perfect Description ‚úçÔ∏è
# 
# Great work identifying the top candies! üéâ Now, let's help the marketing team really sell these tasty treats. üç´ You'll use the `get_llm_response` function provided to you below to generate a short, catchy two-sentence description for each of the top candies. 
# 
# You can adjust the temperature and content variables to fine-tune the responses from the LLM.
# 
# Run the cell below to import the `client` which will help run the `get_llm_response` function.

# In[68]:


from ex5_helper_functions import client


# **Your task:**
# - Play around with different `temperature` settings.
# - Play around with a different `content` description.
# 
# **Note** In order to get a successful grade for this exercise, you have to set values for other than `temperature=0.0` and  `"content": "You are an AI assistant."`
# 
# **Fun Suggestion**: For `content`, you can use "You talk like a Pirate." and temperature as `0.5`.

# In[69]:


### START CODE HERE ###

def get_llm_response(prompt):
    completion = client.chat.completions.create( 
        model='gpt-4o-mini', 
        messages=[ 
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are an rude AI assistant.", # <-- You have to make change here
            },
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt},
        ],
        temperature=0.7, # <-- You have to make change here 
    )
    response = completion.choices[0].message.content 
    return response

### END CODE HERE ###


# In[70]:


# Test your code!
test_your_code.check_change_in_ex5()


# **Note:** Once you see the <span style="color: green;">All tests passed!</span> message, it means you can move on to the next step. Otherwise, make changes to your `get_llm_response` as instructed.

# ### Submission Note:
# If you have passed all the tests up to this point, you can submit your assignment for grading.
# 
# **But before you submit your assignment, re-run the assignment just in case there are any unexpected errors present in the notebook once it goes for grading.** To do so, follow these steps:
# 
# 1. Restart the `Kernel` and select the `Restart & Clear Output` option. You can do this by clicking on the `Kernel` menu at the top of the notebook.
# ![Kernel Restart Image](kernel_restart.png)
# 2. Once the kernel restarts and all outputs are clear, run the cells from top to bottom again up to this point.
# 
# If you have followed these steps and still pass all of the tests, you can submit your assignment for grading. If you encounter any errors, please fix them before submitting.
# 
# To submit your assignment for grading, save your work by clicking the üíæ icon at the top left, then click the <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Submit assignment</span> button at the top right. Good luck!
# 
# Running the below cell is OPTIONAL and will not affect your grading in anyway.

# In[71]:


for candy in top_candies:
    
    prompt = f"""
    For the given candy name, {candy['Candy Name']}, write a short, catchy two-sentence description.
    """
    
    response = get_llm_response(prompt)
    
    print(f"NAME: {candy['Candy Name']}")
    print(f"DESCRIPTION: {response}")
    print()


# ## Conclusion
# That's a wrap! You've used Python to import data, analyze it, and even generate descriptions! Give yourself a pat on the back for completing this assignment. You've taken another step forward in your Python journey, and we can't wait to see what you accomplish next! üòä
